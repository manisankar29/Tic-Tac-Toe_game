## Introduction 

Tic-Tac-Toe, also know as XOXO, is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3*3 grid. This simple yet engaging game involves players taking turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid, with the objective of forming a line of three of their symbols before their opponent does.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on 3*3 grid.
- Two players take turns, one using X and the other O.
- Players alternate turns, placing their symbol in an open cell on the grid.
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols wins.
- If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
